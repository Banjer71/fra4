# Francesco Lomagistro website ..draft 4
Fourth draft for the restyling of one of my customers.

Not being a graphic designer I always try to keep my websites as simple as possible, following the rule : "keep it simple" . 

I found some inspirations looking the Blue Note cover albums website and I experimented with the use of CSS grid and the positioning of images inside the grids.
